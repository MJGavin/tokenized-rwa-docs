\# Overview: Tokenized Real-World Assets in DeFi



Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) bring off-chain economic value on-chain, unlocking a new class of yield-bearing instruments for DeFi participants. This includes invoices, trade finance, real estate, private credit, and other traditionally illiquid assets.



\## Protocol Participants



\- \*\*Asset Originators / Borrowers\*\*: SMEs or businesses that supply tokenized assets (e.g. invoices, real estate deals).

\- \*\*Liquidity Providers / Investors\*\*: Users who supply stablecoins to earn yield by financing these assets.

\- \*\*Service Providers\*\*: Entities offering off-chain data (e.g., credit scoring, legal structuring, oracles).

\- \*\*Protocol DAO / Governance\*\*: Manages risk frameworks, asset approvals, and token economics.



\## Key Processes



1\. \*\*Asset Onboarding\*\*: Borrowers submit documentation; due diligence is performed.

2\. \*\*Tokenization\*\*: A debt token or NFT representing the asset is minted.

3\. \*\*Liquidity Matching\*\*: Investors fund the asset through liquidity pools.

4\. \*\*Repayment\*\*: Borrowers repay principal + interest over time.

5\. \*\*Redemption\*\*: Investors receive returns, often structured into tranches (senior/junior).

| Tranching              | Risk/return segmentation into senior and junior tokens    |

| KYC / Whitelisting     | Often required for investors or borrowers                 |

\## Why RWAs Matter



RWAs bridge DeFi with traditional finance by:

\- Providing real, uncorrelated yields

\- Offering credit to underserved markets (e.g., SMEs)

\- Diversifying DeFi away from purely crypto-native collateral



\## Risks to Consider



\- Default risk (borrowers fail to repay)

\- Legal enforcement of asset claims

\- Protocol governance abuse

\- Illiquidity or withdrawal restrictions
