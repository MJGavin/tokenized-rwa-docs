\# Credit Risk Management



This document outlines how the protocol mitigates credit risk across the lifecycle of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with a focus on transparency, investor protection, and enforceability.



---



\## 1. Defining Credit Risk in Tokenized Assets



Credit risk in tokenized RWAs refers to the possibility that the issuer or underlying obligor of the real-world asset fails to fulfill financial obligations, including:



\- Default on interest or principal

\- Bankruptcy of the SPV or asset originator

\- Legal unenforceability of token-holder claims



---



\## 2. Legal Structuring and SPVs



\- \*\*Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)\*\* isolate credit exposure and bankruptcy risk

\- Legal contracts link on-chain token ownership to real-world asset claims

\- Each asset pool is segregated to ensure ring-fencing in case of issuer default



---



\## 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies



\### a. Asset Vetting



\- Strict onboarding criteria for underlying assets

\- Due diligence by legal, credit, and operational teams



\### b. Independent Trustee / Custodian



\- Off-chain assets are held by a regulated custodian or trustee

\- Trustee fiduciary duty protects token-holder interests



\### c. Payment Waterfall Logic



\- On-chain smart contracts enforce priority of payments

\- Cash flow routing based on tranching and credit seniority



\### d. Credit Enhancements



\- Options for overcollateralization or reserve buffers

\- Insurance or guarantees in select jurisdictions



---



\## 4. Tokenholder Protections



\- \*\*Compliance Module\*\* prevents non-whitelisted actors from acquiring sensitive tranches

\- \*\*Emergency Redemption Triggers\*\* if asset performance drops below defined thresholds

\- \*\*Audit Trails\*\* for both on-chain and off-chain transactions



---



\## 5. Risk Monitoring \& Transparency



\- Monthly asset performance reports published to IPFS and anchored on-chain

\- Real-time NAV updates if feasible

\- Smart contract oracles monitor delinquency, default rates, and external ratings



---



\## 6. Defaults \& Enforcement



\- Triggering a default initiates:

&nbsp; - On-chain freeze of token transfers

&nbsp; - Off-chain legal action by trustee or enforcement agent

\- Investors retain claim priority per legal waterfall



---



\## 7. Interoperability with Rating Agencies



\- Support for token-level credit ratings by on-chain oracles or third-party providers

\- Long-term vision: public/private credit ratings per asset series



---



\## Summary



Our protocol emphasizes robust credit risk management through:

\- Segregated legal structures

\- Transparent, enforceable contracts

\- Smart contract-enforced cash flows

\- Optional tranching and credit enhancements



These elements align with institutional requirements for compliant and scalable RWA issuance.
