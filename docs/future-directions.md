\# Future Directions



This document outlines the roadmap for advancing the protocol’s architecture, scalability, and legal alignment as the tokenized RWA ecosystem matures.



---



\## 1. Multi-Jurisdiction Legal Templates



To enable global scale, we plan to:



\- Develop a suite of jurisdiction-specific legal templates (e.g., Luxembourg RAIF, Delaware LLC, Singapore VCC)

\- Offer selectable templates via UI, with enforcement logic tied to smart contracts

\- Work with law firms to maintain updated legal wrappers in supported jurisdictions



---



\## 2. Lifecycle Automation \& Event Triggers



We will enhance the protocol with programmable lifecycle tools:



\- \*\*Automated maturity \& coupon payments\*\*

\- \*\*Redemption windows\*\*, callable tranches, and bullet amortization

\- Event triggers for defaults, force majeure, and corporate actions

\- Oracle integrations for off-chain legal and financial events



---



\## 3. Secondary Market Liquidity Infrastructure



\- Integrate with decentralized trading venues (e.g. Uniswap, Curve) for permitted tokens

\- Explore institutional bulletin boards and RFQ systems

\- Develop dynamic pricing oracles and NAV streaming to improve tradability

\- Support for OTC transfers via compliant transfer agents



---



\## 4. Institutional Tranching \& Customization



\- On-chain structuring tools for creating senior/subordinated tranches

\- Option for fixed income or equity-like token behavior

\- Dynamic interest rates, variable pricing, and capital reserve logic

\- Token-level governance for capital allocation or reinvestment



---



\## 5. Composability \& Protocol Extensions



\- Integration with DeFi primitives: collateralization, yield strategies, lending protocols

\- Use of RWA tokens as collateral in CDPs or stablecoin vaults

\- Permissioned pools for institutions alongside permissionless retail wrappers

\- Oracle-based NAV attestation for compatibility with DeFi TVL metrics



---



\## 6. Identity \& Compliance Interoperability



\- Reusable, privacy-preserving identity credentials (e.g., zk-KYC)

\- Support for travel rule-compliant messaging between whitelisted entities

\- Verifiable compliance proofs issued by qualified agents



---



\## 7. Sustainability \& ESG-Linked Features



\- Token-level ESG scoring and disclosure

\- Project-specific sustainability reporting

\- Automated impact verification via data oracles

\- Compatibility with green bond or sustainability-linked loan frameworks



---



\## 8. Modular \& Open-Source Governance



\- On-chain protocol governance with tiered access (public vs institutional)

\- Modular system upgrades and decentralized improvement proposals (DIPs)

\- Treasury model for ongoing legal and infrastructure maintenance



---



\## Vision Summary



We envision a globally scalable RWA protocol that combines:



✅ Legal enforceability  

✅ Institutional-grade asset controls  

✅ DeFi-native composability  

✅ Programmable, modular lifecycle tooling  



Each feature aligns with long-term regulatory trends and user demand for transparency, compliance, and liquidity.
