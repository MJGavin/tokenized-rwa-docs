# Tokenized RWA Protocol Documentation

This documentation suite outlines the technical, legal, and strategic foundations of our tokenized real-world asset (RWA) protocol. The protocol enables compliant issuance, management, and trading of tokenized real-world assets — such as private credit, infrastructure financing, or revenue-backed debt — on public blockchains.

## Overview

The protocol combines:

- ✅ Institutional-grade legal wrappers
- ✅ On-chain asset lifecycle management
- ✅ Permissioned and composable DeFi integration
- ✅ Tranching, bundling, and secondary market infrastructure
