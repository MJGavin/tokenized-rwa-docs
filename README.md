# Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) — Protocol Documentation

This project outlines the legal, technical, and strategic foundations for building a tokenized real-world asset (RWA) protocol. It provides an end-to-end view of how off-chain assets can be brought on-chain in a compliant, secure, and composable way.
